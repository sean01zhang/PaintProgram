Change Log:

Changes made to shape.java:
    Added a draw method with the parameters graphics g and color c
    Added a getPoint method that returns the first point of the instance
    Added a contains method that returned true or false if the current object contained the argument object.
        This trickled down to the corresponding subclasses as well


Changes made to specific classes:

    Rectangle.java
        Added a getX and getY method for the rectangle. Returned the x,y value of where the top left corner of the rectangle was.
        Added a setPosition method with the parameters x,y,w,h.
            This sets the position, width, and height of the rectangle.
        
    Triangle.java
        Added a new constructor that gets the x,y, width, and height of the triangle and creates the 3 points of the triangle based off of
        those values.
        Added getters for the width and height of the triangle
            These return the width and height of the triangle

    Point.java
        Other than added methods required from the interface, there is nothing else changed. (draw, contains, and getPoint)

    Line.java
        Other than the added methods required from the interface, there is nothing else changed. (draw, contains)

    Circle.java
        implemented a draw method.

    Square.java
        readjusted the calculations for the constructor

    Polygon.java
        made polygon a non-abstract class.
            This means that all abstract methods were made non-abstract.
                Area was made to return zero instead.
        added a toIntXArray and toIntYArray
            These returns an array of integers of all the x or y values of the polygon.
        added all the required methods from the interface.
            This includes draw, contains, and getPoint.
